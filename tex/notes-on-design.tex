\chapter{Notes on the design}

This class is my personal mix of different book design influences: mainly the works of Edward R. Tufte,\sidecite{TufteTvdq}\sidecite{TufteBE}\sidecite{TufteEI}\sidecite{TufteVE}\index{Tufte, Edward R.} known for the big margin and the plentiness of sidenotes and sidecaptions. The margins are however not as prominent as in Tufte's works, the main text takes a bit more space, more like in Robert Bringhurt's typographer's bible.\sidecite{BringhurstEoTS}\index{Bringhurst, Robert} So it is a bit of a mix of Tufte and Bringhurst, with some of my own choices for other design features, as we will see through this chapter.
