Thie project hosts the LaTeX source for a proposed book. The book will cover
elementary aerodynamics and analysis techniqurs to produce an initial
assessment of the performnce of aproposed design. The layout of the model will
be done using OpenSCAD enabling an assessment og the model weight and balance.
This book will not cover actual building and flying, since that is well covered
in Ron Williams classif *Building and Flying Info=door mOdel Airplanes*. ll
analytical tools usedin this book are written in Python. The theoretical parts
of this book were validated using the Python SymPy symbolic mathematics
library. 

All code produced in this work has been tested on Windows 11, Mac OS-X 12, and Ubuntu 20.04.

The document is written in *LaTeX* using the **tufte-latex** style.  All figures
were produced using the *Asymptote* package. Screen shots wre captured using
*Snagit* on a Macbook Pro.
